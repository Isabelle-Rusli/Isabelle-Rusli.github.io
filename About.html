		  <h2><br><br><br>Badminton Career</h2>
    <p><br>I'm an <em>athlete.</em> Ever since I was little, I was fortunate enough to play and excel in many different sports including gymanstics, swimming, soccer, softball, and dance due to my competitive nature. However, the one sport that stuck with me the most was badminton. I've called the court my "second home" ever since I was 10 years old. I've been training hard to become a top-level badminton player. I was able to train in Solo, Indonesia with the legend Mulyo Handoyo (Taufik Hidayat's coach) for one year and in Nanning, China for three months with the Guang Xi National Team. Training with the Guang Xi National Team was an amazing experience because I was able to train under Zhao JianHua, one of the greatest men's singles players of all time. During my junior career, my highest achievement was reaching the national rank of two in the under-19 womens singles category and qualifying for the junior Pan American Games in Brazil and World Championships in Canada. After my junior career was over, I acquired my first sponsorship from Flypower, an Indonesian brand for badminton equipment, and started playing international tournaments to build my <a href="https://bwfbadminton.com/player/89998/isabelle-rusli" target="_blank" style = "color: #3891A6"><b>world ranking</b></a>. Being able to travel to foreign contries such as Guatemala, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Laos, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, New Zealand, Belgium, and Japan to do what I love has been a dream come true. I've been able to meet friends from all over the world, grow from every tournament, and open my eyes to different cultures. If you would like private training, please personal message me! I'm open to all levels. </p>

		<h2><br><br><br>Campus Involvement</h2> </div>
		<div class="about_campus">
    <p><br>I have been part of the <a href="https://linktr.ee/uclabaddy" target="_blank" style = "color: #3891A6"><b>UCLA Club Badminton</b></a> team for two years and am currently serving as the treasure of the team. After years of being unable to host our big annual tournament due to the pandemic, we were finally able to host Bruin Open this year! I took part in organizing, managing, and even taking part in the two-day tournament. Since it was the first time my team ran a tournament we planned months in advanced hoping it would go smoothly. We did end up running into a few complications the first day but was quickly able to recognize our mistakes and resolved it the second day. Additionally, I have also been a member of the <a href="https://acabruins.org/" target="_blank" style = "color: #3891A6"><b>Association of Chinese Americans (ACA)</b></a> here on campus. It's a student organization focused on creating a community of Chinese Americans with the goal of understanding their culture and heritage. </p>
